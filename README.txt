6.8.2021:

    I decided to keep trying to learn more Dash/Data Visualiztion GUIs with Python as oppose to venturing off to pygame. The benefit is to maybe help me with some work ideas 
    and I feel like if I stray off to an of course field I will lose my knowledge here which can help in my career (not that pygame wouldn't).

    I watched videos 1-5 on my work laptop which SentDex talked about some intro to Dash tools using JSON data from a website.

    Videos 6 - 12 will be transcribed in this repo as my notes. I'll look to have several py files for each video and eventually keep an organize final version when I get a good grasp
    of things.
