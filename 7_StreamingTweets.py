# Tweepy is an open source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python. 
# Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that represent Twitterâ€™s models and RESTful API endpoints, and it transparently handles various implementation details.

# A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. 
# That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

# REST = Representational State Transfer. REST or RESTful API design (Representational State Transfer) is designed to take advantage of existing protocols. 
# While REST can be used over nearly any protocol, it usually takes advantage of HTTP when used for Web APIs. 
# This means that developers do not need to install libraries or additional software in order to take advantage of a REST API design.
